### Database Updates
- ✅ `quotes` table updated with new schema
- ✅ `email_logs` table created
- ✅ Migration applied to production D1

### Deployment Infrastructure
- ✅ Validation scripts created (validate-endpoints, pre-deploy, safe-deploy)
- ✅ Deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT.md, DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
- ✅ Type definitions updated

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Test in Production
Login to www.jetchance.com and test:
- [ ] Quote form on landing page
- [ ] Admin dashboard (quotes, stats)
- [ ] Operator flight creation with image upload
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Booking workflows

### 2. Enable Email Service (Optional)
Currently emails are logged but not sent. To enable:
1. Sign up for email service (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
2. Add API key to wrangler.jsonc
3. Uncomment email sending code in `src/handlers/email.ts`

### 3. Future Deployments
Always use validation before deploying:
```powershell
cd workers/jetchance-api
npm run safe-deploy
```

## 🔍 Known Issues

### TypeScript Warnings
There are 54 TypeScript errors (mostly type assertions on `unknown`).
These don't affect runtime but should be fixed for better type safety.

**Fix in next PR**: Add proper interfaces for request bodies.

### Validation Script Limitations
- `validate-endpoints.mjs` needs adjustment for complex routes
- `grep` command not available on Windows (skipped in validation)
